Take the goat across first.
(Farmer and goat cross. Wolf + cabbage stay behind.)

Go back alone.
(Farmer rows back.)

Take the wolf across.
(Farmer and wolf cross.)

Bring the goat back.
(Farmer takes goat back to the starting side.)

Take the cabbage across.
(Farmer and cabbage cross.)

Go back alone.
(Farmer rows back.)

Finally, take the goat across again.
(Farmer and goat cross.)

Now everyone is on the other side safely so, the goat was never left alone with the wolf or the cabbage.

4 1  2 3

Start with Box 1 (top-left 2×2):
It already has a 3. The only place left for 1 is r1c1 , put 1 there.

Find the last 3:
Each row needs one 3. Rows 1–3 already have theirs, so row 4 must have the last 3. It must go in Box 4 (bottom-right 2×2) and column 4 is the only free spot ,r4c4 = 3.

Place 1 in row 3:
Row 3 still needs a 1,, The only possible spot is r3c3 ,= 1.

Fill the rest with 2s and 4s:
After this, all empty spots must be 2 or 4. So, there are only 2 ways to to solve without breaking sudoku rules.

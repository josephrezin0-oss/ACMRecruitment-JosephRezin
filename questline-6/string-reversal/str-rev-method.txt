1.Iterative method
We reverse the string by using a loop and building a new string ,character by character, from the end of the original string.

for this ,first we initialize an empty string. by traversing input string from last to first character and then appending each 
characte to the new string, we follow iterative method.

 2. Recursive Method
We reverse the string by using recursion ie( each function call processes one character and calls itself for the rest of the string.)


consider Base case: if string length is 0 or 1, return the string itself.
 Recursive case:to reverse the substring excluding the first characte and then appending the first character at the end.

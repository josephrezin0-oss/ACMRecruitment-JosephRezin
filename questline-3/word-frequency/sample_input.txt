I saw a cat, a cat that was sitting on the wall.
The cat looked at me, and I looked at the cat.
It was a sunny day, a bright sunny day, and the cat seemed happy.
I walked closer, closer and closer, and the cat did not move.
The wall was old, very old, and the bricks were red, very red.
The sun was shining, shining so bright that the cat almost closed its eyes.
I sat down, sat down slowly, and watched the cat.
The cat blinked, blinked again, and again, like it was saying hello.
The day felt calm, calm and peaceful, and I stayed there for a long time.
